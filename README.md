# Real-Time
Real-time object detection is the process of identifying and locating objects within a digital image or video in real-time. It is commonly used in applications such as surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality to quickly recognize and track objects as they move.
Various techniques are used for real-time object detection, including deep learning approaches like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once) and SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) that enable fast processing of images for detection purposes.
